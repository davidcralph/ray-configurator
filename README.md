# ray-configurator
GUI for configurating ray-mmd

This configuration utility allows you to change settings of ray-mmd without needing to know how it works or what everything means. It has helpful tooltips and a lightweight GUI.

Supports both ray-mmd-dev and ray-mmd 1.5.2. It may work with versions older or the master branch, but the code still needs optimising.
